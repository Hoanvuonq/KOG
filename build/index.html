  there was a meme coin called Bonk Inu. Bonk Inu had made quite a
  splash in the crypto community on the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain.
  It was not like other cryptocurrencies; it had a unique charm.
  Bonk Inu's journey began when a group of anonymous developers,
  inspired by the meme culture of the internet, decided to create
  a cryptocurrency that would be both fun and functional.
  They wanted to make something that would bring laughter to the crypto
  world while still offering real utility."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><title>BONK</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.9d00f1f6.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.eb3b52bf.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
