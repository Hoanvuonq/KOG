                    Pepie, also known as Pepe the Zombie, is a unique and enigmatic character in the digital world. 
                    Unlike the typical Pepe meme, Pepie stands out with his eerie appearance. 
                    He is portrayed as a zombie-like creature with pallid, decaying green skin and vacant, haunting eyes. 
                    Pepie's presence evokes a sense of unease and curiosity, making him a distinct and memorable figure in the meme universe.
